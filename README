# Peasys Ruby Library

The Peasys Ruby library provides convenient access to the Peasys service from
applications written in the Ruby language. It includes a pre-defined set of
classes and functions for connection and sql query execution on the DB2.

## Documentation

See the [Ruby docs](https://dips400.com/docs).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the gem. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
gem install peasys
```

If you want to build the gem from source:

```sh
gem build peasys-ruby.gemspec
```

## Usage

For a comprehensive list of examples, check out the [documentation](https://dips400.com/docs).

### Connexion

Peasys is a tool used along a license that should be found on the dips400 website. This license key along with the client ID are required for the use of the service Peasys.

```ruby
require "peasys"

conn = PeaClient.new("DNS_OR_IP", "PARTITION_NAME", PORT, "USERNAME", "PASSWORD", "ID_CLIENT", true, false)
puts conn.connexion_message
conn.disconnect
```

### Query the Db2
For example, use the executeCreate method of the PeaClient class in order to create a a new table in the database.

```ruby
PeaCreateResponse createResponse = conn.execute_create("CREATE TABLE schema_name/table_name (name CHAR(10), age INT)");
puts createResponse.sql_message
puts createResponse.sql_state
```

### Deconnexion
It is important to always disconnect from the server after you used the connexion.

```ruby
conn.disconnect
```

## Support

New features and bug fixes are released on the latest major version of the Peasys Ruby library. If you are on an older major version, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest in order to use the new features and bug fixes including those for security vulnerabilities. Older major versions of the package will continue to be available for use, but will not be receiving any updates.
